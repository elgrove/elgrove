### Hi there 👋

🔭  I’m currently working on These Times, a newsreader with articles from paywalled sites, built in a microservices-style architecture with communication between containers via HTTP

🌱  I created [nflfunindex.com](https://www.nflfunindex.com), a website that scrapes data and ranks NFL games for how fun they were to watch  

🔎  I'm currently looking for software developer or data engineer positions

📦  I have experience of building projects from start to finish, including containerised deployment on my own server  

💬 Contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-lloyd-13206620b)
