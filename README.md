### Hello, I'm Aaron 👋

🐍  I make websites with Python and JavaScript, and love tinkering with Linux servers at home and in the cloud  

🚢  I just shipped the first release of [These Times](https://news.elgrove.xyz), a news aggregator with articles from paywalled sites  

🌱  I’m also working on `gong`, another one of those static site generators inspired by Jekyll

🏈  I created [nflfunindex.com](https://www.nflfunindex.com), a website that rates past NFL games for how fun they were to watch  

🔎  I'm currently looking for a software or data engineer position in London or remote

📦  I have built projects from start to finish including containerised deployment on my own server
