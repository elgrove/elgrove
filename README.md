### Hello 👋

🐍  I primarily work in Python  

🔭  I’m currently working on These Times, a newsreader with articles from paywalled sites  

🌱  I created [nflfunindex.com](https://www.nflfunindex.com), a website rates NFL games for how fun they were to watch  

🔎  I'm currently looking for software developer or data engineer positions

📦  I have experience of building projects from start to finish, including containerised deployment on my own server
