### Hello, I'm Aaron 👋

🐍  I'm a Python specialist with experience all over the ecosystem

🦄  I'm currently working for a pioneer in behavioural analytics for investment professionals

🧱  We're building a new platform for scale on AWS with event-driven, serverless microservices

🛠  I'm interested in modern tooling that can make a developer's life easier

🏘  I like to write code to solve problems in my day-to-day life, the fruits of which can be found here

🐎  Check out the AWS Chalice & Terraform pattern for super fast app development, I think it's pretty cool

💬  You can contact me by email: hello at lgrv dot net
